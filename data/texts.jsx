    </ul>
    <p className="p"> Below you can find information from which you will learn about this unique material , get acquainted with the main advantages , and understand how this brick tile differs from other cladding options .</p>

    <p className="h4"> Production features </p>
    <p className="p"> Clinker is a building material that is obtained by <b> firing refractory clay </b> in a special tunnel kiln at a temperature of 1200 C. Tiles are produced in the same way as clinker bricks - clay purified from impurities is squeezed out of an extruder under high pressure , like toothpaste from a tube . Next, a special thread is used to cut the tiles into a given format , then they are dried and baked in an oven for two to three days . At the same time, the tiles are not inferior to brick in their physical characteristics - impressive moisture absorption rates of 3% and the number of frost resistance cycles of 250 make this material especially strong and durable .</p>
    <p className="p"> There is a <b> cardinal difference </b> in the production of products from refractory and ordinary , in particular , Russian clay . From ordinary types of clay you can make ceramics , i.e. To . it , unlike refractory , has a different composition and its maximum firing temperature will be no more than 800 C. Ceramics are inferior to clinker in strength and durability . The range of clinker tiles for facades is very rich and amounts to several hundred different options . All are different in color , surface and format , which you can view on our website .</p>
    <p className="p"> As for visual perception, not a single builder or architect <b> will determine what the façade of the building is faced with - brick or tile </b>. After all, visually we see only the surface . Modern building mixtures make it possible to glue tiles in such a way that their tear strength will be high , and the layer of clinker with adhesive mortar will be even stronger in its mass than solid ceramic bricks .</p>
    <h2 className="h2"> Clinker tiles for the facade - price per m2 in Moscow </h2>
    <p className="p"> The price per m 2 of clinker tiles for facades imported to Russia <b> ranges from 50 to 150 euros </b> per square meter . The cost is determined by two factors - production and transportation costs . Since deposits of refractory clay suitable for clinker production are not found in Russia, all products are supplied from Germany and Poland . Production is very energy-intensive - huge volumes of gas and electricity are consumed . Prices for most items are set in euros , invoices are issued at the rate of the Central Bank of the Russian Federation on the day of payment . However, the cost does not include consumables , such as special solutions for laying and filling joints . Also important <b> factors influencing the price are format and surface </b>.</p>
    <ul>
      <li className="bullet"> Thus , tiles of standard NF format 240*71 mm will cost much less than those whose sizes have exclusive parameters - for example, for the exquisite series Riegel50 or Glanzstueck with a length of 440-490 mm you will have to pay up to 150 euros / m 2 .</li>
      <li className="bullet"> If the surface is smooth and even - i.e. e . nothing was used in manufacturing to give a unique appearance , such tiles will cost less than an aged or glazed front side .</li>
    </ul>
    <p className="p"> Clinker tiles for facades were first brought to Russia in the early 90s . Since then, it has gained popularity and is rightfully considered one of the best options for external cladding . Whereas in Europe it has already become widespread since the 1980s . years _ It was originally created and used where standard format facing bricks cannot be used - for example, when reconstructing facades and insulating buildings . But over time, it won the hearts of developers with its appearance , ease of installation and price , which is lower than the cost of solid or slotted clinker bricks .</p>

    <p className="h4"> Analogues of clinker tiles for facades </p>
    <p className="p"> Today, brick-like façade tiles are found in <b> several types </b>:</p>
    <ul>
      <li className="bullet"><b> Clinker </b> - has a lot of different variations in color and surface . Relatively expensive when compared with domestic ceramics , which are inferior in appearance and strength . <b> The service life is several decades </b> without changing the color shade . Durable in terms of maintaining the original appearance . Cost from 50 euros / m2 .</li>
      <li className="bullet"><b> Artificial stone </b> is also inferior in appearance . These are vibropressed concrete tiles to which chemical color pigments are added . The characteristics will be comparatively lower due to moisture absorption of up to 10%, or even higher . Over time, such tiles <b> will fade and become covered with small cracks </b>. Whereas for clinker, the moisture absorption rate varies within 3-6%, because of this it almost does not absorb water and temperature differences have little effect on it . Concrete tiles can be bought for less than 1000 rubles / m2 .</li>
      <li className="bullet"><b> Porcelain tile </b>, but this material is unsuitable for use on the facade . It <b> lacks vapor permeability </b>. Steam passes through the walls , encountering such a surface, steam can pass through the seams , but will still tend to pass through the tiles . The result will be cracks throughout the entire surface . Clinker is a particularly durable material , but quite vapor-permeable , as it has a unique pore structure .</li>
    </ul>
    <p className="p"> In addition to the above materials for facade cladding, there are also a lot of cheaper materials such as plaster , paint , siding and various types of panels . As you can see , today there are a lot of options for exterior decoration , so why do clinker tiles for facades deserve your choice ?</p>

    <h2 className="h2">FELDHAUS KLINKER</h2>
    <p className="p"> German plant Feldhaus Klinker ( Feldhaus Klinker ) since 1981 . produces clinker tiles for bricks of the highest level , thanks to which over the past 40 years the business has grown into a large international company with representative offices in more than 30 countries . Moreover, Russia is one of the key markets for product sales , because our climate causes significant damage to buildings , and the use of tiles as a facing material serves as good protection . In total, about 140 chic colors are produced , the permanent warehouse program in Moscow includes 68 color solutions in the NF 240 * 71 * 14 mm format , the price starts from 23.99 euros m 2, for each article there is a corner element .</p>

    <h2 className="h2"> Review of Feldhaus Klinker facade tiles </h2>
    <p className="p"> The SINTRA series has gained particular popularity , which imitates hand molding and visually represents aged brick . Characterized by torn edges and rough surface . Looking at it, one gets the impression of the durability of the building , because no matter how many hundreds of years nature has tried to change the facade of such a building, the most it can do is leave its traces on it . Today 26 colors are produced , from light cream to dark brown and anthracite shades . There are 17 colors in stock in Moscow in NF format, 14 mm .</p>
    <p className="p"> The VASCU series from the Feldhaus Klinker plant represents 39 beautiful colors made in one type of surface - water strokes . As if carved by water from top to bottom , the surface is covered with small stripes . It also resembles the appearance of a century ago , but unlike Sintra it has smooth edges . Here you can select quite a few shades for every taste - from monochromatic to brightly variegated , with combinations of several colors , for example R769NF14 - on a red base you can find dark cinnamon soot and a yellow coating . 12 colors are available in the Moscow warehouse in NF format, 14 mm .</p>
    <p className="p">GALENA attracts with its even and smooth surface , based on red clay covered with engobe . A facade covered with such tiles is discreet , but at the same time individual and attractive , thanks to the play of color in the sun . The series is presented in 6 colors , 5 of which are always available in Moscow in the NF 240*71*14 mm format . </p>
    <p className="p"> Revival of a surface that was once considered substandard . The CARBONA and SALINA series go hand in hand in embodying the idea of molten firing on the front surface of the tile . When baking in an oven, a technology is used that resembles a uniform supply of oxygen balls - when confronted with a tile , the fire exceeds the average temperature and leaves its mark on the clay . Similar to the Galena series, however, it is distinguished by rough dark spots on the front side of the tile . Available in 9 colors , in stock , one item R560NF14 is available for shipment right now .</p>
    <p className="p"> Chasing , or in translation ACCUDO is also similar to GALENA, but it is distinguished by small dents on the surface , as if from chasing . Very expressive shades play beautifully in the sun , and seem to completely change colors when it rains . Available in three colors in Moscow , in NF format , 14 mm .</p>
    <p className="p"> The Feldhaus Klinker plant is innovative and is always ready to offer completely new color solutions to the most demanding needs . So , in 2016 VARIO and BACCO appeared . Unlike the above series , 16 striking colors represent the uniqueness and unsurpassed appearance , beauty of clinker tiles , created with the participation of the world's best architects and designers . Currently available for order from Germany in NF format in a thickness of 14 mm , not supported in stock in Moscow .</p>
    <p className="p"> Closes this review of the manufacturer Feldhaus Clinker CLASSIC - one of the first series , produced in a thickness of 9 mm , about 30 colors of the NF format are available for shipment in Moscow . The most budget option of all presented , however, this does not mean a lower level of product quality . After all , all series are made from clays of a certain characteristic , i.e. e . the tile itself will be durable , but in such thicknesses surfaces with the effect of aged brick are not produced - but there are a lot of chic solid colors and variegated shades .</p>

    <h2 className="h2"> History of the Feldhaus Klinker plant</h2>
    <p className="p"> The founding date is considered to be 1857 , when the hereditary farmer Bernhardt Feldhaus in the German city of Bad Laer commissioned a small enterprise for the production of clay bricks . At that time, production was significantly different from modern production, and no one produced tiles for facades . Almost all the work was done manually , and energy costs were simply enormous compared to current ones . The clay was mined with shovels and picks , then it was cleaned and kneaded using a rotary mill to give the desired consistency . Then , using simple forms , the brick was given the desired proportions and size , and sent to dry for several weeks in the open air . Since the beginning of the 19th century, coal has been used as fuel .</p>
    <p className="p"> Bernhardt Feldhaus in 1868 decided to modernize his enterprise and built a large ring furnace . According to the instructions of local authorities, the plant had to be located away from cultivated land and residential buildings , and in order to avoid fire and smoke, the chimney had to be at least 15 meters high . The new furnace functioned properly for almost 100 years .</p>
    <p className="p"> At first, the products were in demand exclusively among private homeowners , but with rare exceptions, deliveries were also made for public needs . This is how St. Mary 's Church was built in Bad Laer in 1874 . made of Feldhaus Klinker brick . The company gradually increased volumes and improved production technology , so in 1929 a conveyor for automatically adding coal to the furnace was put into operation , and in 1939 a 60- meter long drying tunnel was put into operation .</p>
    <p className="p"> However, the company began using more modern equipment in 1966, with the construction of a 78 - meter - long tunnel furnace; ten years later it was extended to 113 meters.Here the firing process could be controlled and the production process became less labor intensive.New press machines were installed that compressed the clay, giving it strength characteristics; their productivity for that time was colossal and amounted to 8,000 bricks / hour(currently more than 20,000 bricks / hour).However, a real breakthrough can be considered in 1981, when the Feldhaus Klinker plant began producing brick - like façade clinker tiles.At that time, there were 35 employees, the plant consumed 70,000 tons of clay per year, more than three million cubic meters of natural gas, 1.8 million kilowatt / hour of electricity.</p >
    <p className="p"> In the early 2000s , production was equipped with high-precision computer sensors that allow monitoring humidity , temperature of the composition being fired , and setting material supply programs . New types of front surface are emerging , which are achieved through the use of special rollers .</p>

    <h2 className="h2"> Review of Roben clinker tiles </h2>
    <p className="p">AARHUS, manufacturer Roben is a beautiful embodiment of ancient brickwork , which remains unshakable and unchanged , with a hint of eternity . Remaining itself and maintaining its appearance and shade for decades , it protects the building from external influences , leaving the impression of reliability and security of the fortress . Available in seven incomparable NF- format colors in a thickness of 14 mm and is always available in large quantities in stock in Moscow .</p>
    <p className="p">MANUS is a continuation of the theme of the hand-molded effect , when a clay brick is cut from the front side . It also resembles an aged look , is available in ten colors that will emphasize the status of the house and make it luxurious , while maintaining all the properties of clinker - low moisture absorption and frost resistance . The Roben factory has set a very attractive price for this type of surface and shades , taking into account the standard NF format and thickness of 14 mm .</p>
    <p className="p">FORMBACK - unlike the above items, it has a moisture absorption rate of 10%, the tile is less durable , but remains attractive in appearance and resembles an unpressed , sintered brick , on the front side of which rounded lines from clay settlement are visible . It gives the impression of hand-molded piece production . The cost is about 50 euros / m2 , produced and kept in stock in four colors .</p>
    <p className="p"> Unlike other manufacturers, Concert Roben does not adhere to strict rules in grouping the colors of facade tiles and dividing them into specific series . Let us note the less numerous lines of colors united by a similar surface or shade .</p>

Available with a smooth and even surface , as well as with small depressions on the front side , barely visible to the eye . MONTBLANC and ISLAND differ in surface and it is quite difficult to express this difference in words : the front side resembles dents made by a stone , or as if someone had crushed the tile before firing to give it an uneven shape . Pearl white color is traditionally considered to be in an aristocratic style . Kaolin contained in clay gives it a special whiteness , thanks to which clinker facade tiles will retain their shade for decades and will not be subject to change .</p>
    <p className="p"> Dark colors are represented by the names FARO, CHELSEA, MANCHESTER and SYDNEY.</p>
    <p className="p"> Classic red colors are due to the admixtures of iron and potassium in the clay , and are one of the best in terms of price / quality ratio , i.e. To . this is the most common type of clay . Roben clinker tiles are available in various red shades , incl . h . with a fired or glowing blue coating , with a traditional flat surface or a textured front .</p>

    <p className="p">KERAVETTE chromatic and flame are the classic colors of 11 mm thick NF clinker bricks . Attractive, unobtrusive shades are in great demand from year to year due to the excellent price-quality ratio . Made from the best varieties of refractory clay , like all Stroeher clinker tiles, they have colossal frost resistance values of 250 cycles , and a color palette of 16 colors will satisfy the traditional needs of designers and architects .</p>
    <p className="p">HANDSTRICH ( Handstrich ) - DF tile format 240*52*14 - another bold idea of German technologists , but which has not received due recognition - brick tiles are quite attractive , but cannot yet withstand price competition from others options .</p>
